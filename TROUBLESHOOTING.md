## Advanced Troubleshooting

This is the **#1 most common issue**. Here's why it happens and how to fix it.

### The Problem

You updated the code on GitHub, but when you visit your live site, you still see the old version. This is frustrating!

### Why This Happens

There are **THREE SEPARATE THINGS** that need to sync up:

1. **Your Code on GitHub** (e.g., the `main` branch)
2. **The Deployed Site** (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.)
3. **Your Browser's Cache**

If ANY of these are out of sync, you'll see old content.

---

## Solution: Follow These Steps IN ORDER

### Step 1: Verify Your Code is on GitHub

```bash
git status
git log --oneline -5
```

Make sure:
- ‚úÖ Your changes are committed: `git commit -m "Your changes"`
- ‚úÖ Your changes are pushed: `git push origin main`
- ‚úÖ You're on the right branch: `git branch` (should show `* main`)

### Step 2: Check Which Branch is Deployed

**For GitHub Pages:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/scott-a11y/proposal-builder/settings/pages
2. Look at "Source"
3. Note which branch it deploys (usually `main` or `gh-pages`)

**For Netlify:**
1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/
2. Find your site
3. Go to Site Settings ‚Üí Build & Deploy
4. Check "Production branch"

**For Vercel:**
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your project
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí Git
4. Check "Production Branch"

### Step 3: Make Sure Your Changes Are on the Deployed Branch

If your hosting deploys from `gh-pages` but you pushed to `main`, your changes won't appear!

**To check:**
```bash
git checkout gh-pages  # Or whatever your deploy branch is
git log --oneline -5   # Should show your recent changes
```

**If your changes aren't there:**
```bash
git checkout gh-pages
git merge main         # Merge your changes from main
git push origin gh-pages
```

### Step 4: Run the Version Checker

```bash
./check-deployed-version.sh
```

This will tell you:
- ‚úÖ **UP TO DATE**: Your deployed site matches your code
- ‚ùå **OUTDATED**: Your deployed site is behind your code
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Cannot reach**: Site isn't deployed at that URL

### Step 5: Wait for Deployment (IF OUTDATED)

If the version checker shows OUTDATED:

1. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for deployment
2. **Check GitHub Actions**: https://github.com/scott-a11y/proposal-builder/actions
3. **Run version checker again**: `./check-deployed-version.sh`

### Step 6: Clear Your Browser Cache

Even after deployment completes, your browser might show old content.

**Quick fix:**
- **Hard refresh**: Ctrl + F5 (Windows) or Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
- **Incognito mode**: Open a private/incognito window
- **Different browser**: Try a browser you haven't used recently

**Nuclear option (if hard refresh doesn't work):**
- Chrome/Edge: Ctrl + Shift + Delete ‚Üí Check "Cached images and files" ‚Üí Clear
- Firefox: Ctrl + Shift + Delete ‚Üí Check "Cache" ‚Üí Clear Now
- Safari: Cmd + Option + E

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario A: "I pushed to `main` but GitHub Pages deploys from `gh-pages`"

**Solution:**
```bash
git checkout gh-pages
git merge main
git push origin gh-pages
```

### Scenario B: "GitHub Actions updated the version but I still see old code"

**Problem:** GitHub Actions updates the version on `main`, but your hosting might deploy from a different branch.

**Solution:** Check which branch your hosting deploys from (Step 2 above).

### Scenario C: "I see different versions on different computers"

**Problem:** Each device has its own browser cache.

**Solution:** Clear cache on ALL devices, or use incognito mode.

### Scenario D: "It works in incognito but not in normal browsing"

**Problem:** Your normal browser has cached the old version.

**Solution:** Clear your browser cache (Step 6 above).

### Scenario E: "The version checker says UP TO DATE but I still see old content"

**Problem:** Your browser has an aggressive cache or a service worker.

**Solution:**
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab ‚Üí Service Workers
3. Click "Unregister" for any service workers
4. Go to Application tab ‚Üí Storage
5. Click "Clear site data"
6. Hard refresh (Ctrl + F5)

## Advanced Debugging

### Check What Your Browser Actually Received

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Network** tab
3. Hard refresh (Ctrl + F5)
4. Find `index.html` in the list
5. Click it ‚Üí **Response** tab
6. Search for `<!-- Version:` in the response
7. **The version should match your code!**

If the version in the Network tab is OLD:
- Your CDN/hosting provider hasn't updated yet (wait 10 minutes)
- You're hitting a cached CDN node (clear CDN cache)

If the version in the Network tab is NEW but you see OLD content:
- Your browser is using cached JS/CSS files
- Clear browser cache completely (Step 6 above)

### Check GitHub Actions

1. Go to: https://github.com/scott-a11y/proposal-builder/actions
2. Look for recent workflow runs
3. Click on the most recent one
4. Check if it succeeded or failed

If it failed:
- Click on the failed job to see error logs
- Fix the error in your code
- Push again

### Check Deployment Logs

**Netlify:**
1. Dashboard ‚Üí Deploys
2. Click on most recent deploy
3. Check "Deploy log" for errors

**Vercel:**
1. Dashboard ‚Üí Deployments
2. Click on most recent deployment
3. Check "Building" log for errors

**GitHub Pages:**
- Usually no detailed logs available
- Check Actions tab for build failures

## Prevention: How to Avoid This Issue

### 1. Always Use the Update Script

After making changes to JS or CSS files:
```bash
./update-version.sh
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Wait for Deployment Before Testing

After pushing:
1. Wait 5 minutes
2. Run `./check-deployed-version.sh`
3. If OUTDATED, wait another 5 minutes
4. Only then test in browser

### 3. Test in Incognito Mode First

This bypasses your browser cache and shows you what new visitors see.

### 4. Set Up a Staging Environment

Deploy to a staging URL first:
- Netlify: Deploy previews for pull requests
- Vercel: Preview deployments
- GitHub: Create a `staging` branch and deploy from that

## Still Stuck?

If you've tried everything above and still have issues:

1. **Run the version checker**: `./check-deployed-version.sh`
2. **Check GitHub Actions**: https://github.com/scott-a11y/proposal-builder/actions
3. **Open an issue** with:
   - URL you're viewing
   - Output of `./check-deployed-version.sh`
   - Screenshot of DevTools Network tab showing the version
   - Which branch your hosting deploys from

## Quick Reference

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Don't see changes | Run `./check-deployed-version.sh` |
| Outdated deployment | Wait 10 minutes, check again |
| Browser shows old | Hard refresh (Ctrl + F5) |
| Different branch | Merge changes to deploy branch |
| GitHub Actions failed | Check actions tab, fix errors |
| CDN cache | Wait 10 minutes or clear CDN |

**Remember:** Just because your code is on GitHub doesn't mean your live site is updated. Always verify with the version checker!
