# Cache-Busting Automation - PERMANENT FIX

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Issue**: Cache-busting version was not being updated despite extensive documentation, causing users to see stale cached files after deployments.

**Root Cause**: Manual process (`./update-version.sh`) required human memory and discipline, which was frequently forgotten.

**Solution**: Fully automated cache-busting version updates with multiple safeguards.

---

## ✅ Automated Solutions Implemented

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow (Primary)

**File**: `.github/workflows/auto-version-update.yml`

**What it does**:
- Automatically runs on every push to `main` branch
- Detects if JavaScript or CSS files were modified
- Updates cache-busting version to current timestamp
- Runs verification tests
- Commits and pushes the update automatically

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Zero manual intervention required
- ✅ Works for all contributors
- ✅ Guaranteed to run on every deployment
- ✅ Includes automated testing

**How it works**:
```yaml
1. Push code to main
2. GitHub Actions detects JS/CSS changes
3. Workflow runs update-version.sh
4. Tests verify correctness
5. New version is committed and pushed
6. Deployment proceeds with fresh version
```

### 2. Git Pre-Push Hook (Backup)

**File**: `setup-git-hooks.sh`

**What it does**:
- Checks cache-busting version before every `git push`
- Prompts developer if version is outdated
- Offers to update version automatically
- Prevents push until version is current

**Setup** (one-time per developer):
```bash
./setup-git-hooks.sh
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Catches issues before they reach GitHub
- ✅ Interactive prompts for developer control
- ✅ Works for local development workflow
- ✅ Optional safety net for manual pushes

### 3. Manual Script (Still Available)

**File**: `update-version.sh`

**When to use**:
- Testing locally before committing
- Manual version updates for special cases
- Troubleshooting cache issues

**Usage**:
```bash
./update-version.sh
```

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### For Most Users (Automatic)

**Simply push to main and forget about it:**

```bash
# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push origin main

# GitHub Actions automatically:
# 1. Detects the push
# 2. Updates cache-busting version
# 3. Runs tests
# 4. Commits and pushes update
# 5. ✅ Done!
```

### For Developers with Git Hook (Interactive)

```bash
# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push origin main

# Pre-push hook checks version:
# ⚠️  Cache-busting version is outdated!
#    Current: 202509301536 (from 20250930)
#    Today:   20251001
# 
# Would you like to update it now? [Y/n]

# Press Y:
# 🔄 Updating version...
# ✅ Version updated! Please commit these changes and push again.
#
# Run:
#   git commit -m 'chore: update cache-busting version'
#   git push
```

## 🎓 Understanding the Version Format

**Format**: `YYYYMMDDHHmm`

**Example**: `202510010425`
- `2025` = Year
- `10` = October
- `01` = Day 1
- `04` = Hour (4 AM)
- `25` = Minute

**Why timestamps?**
- ✅ Unique for every deployment
- ✅ No collisions with multiple daily deployments
- ✅ Sortable chronologically
- ✅ Human-readable

---

## 📋 Verification

### Check Current Version

```bash
# View version in index.html
grep "<!-- Version:" index.html

# Run verification tests
./test-cache-busting.sh
```

### Expected Output

```
✅ All cache-busting tests passed!
```

### Verify in Browser

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Reload page (Ctrl+F5 for hard refresh)
4. Look for files like `brand.css?v=202510010425`
5. Version should match current timestamp

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### GitHub Actions Not Running

**Check**:
```bash
# View workflow runs
gh run list --workflow=auto-version-update.yml

# View workflow file
cat .github/workflows/auto-version-update.yml
```

**Fix**:
- Ensure workflow file exists in `.github/workflows/`
- Check GitHub Actions is enabled for the repository
- Verify GITHUB_TOKEN has write permissions

### Git Hook Not Working

**Check**:
```bash
# Verify hook is installed
ls -l .git/hooks/pre-push

# Test hook manually
.git/hooks/pre-push
```

**Fix**:
```bash
# Reinstall hook
./setup-git-hooks.sh

# Make sure it's executable
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push
```

### Version Not Updating

**Manual Override**:
```bash
# Force update version
./update-version.sh

# Commit and push
git add index.html admin-loader.js test-cache-busting.sh
git commit -m "chore: force update cache-busting version"
git push
```

## 🎯 Migration Guide

### For Existing Deployments

If you have an old deployment with stale cache:

1. **This PR includes updated version** (`202510010425`)
2. **Users must hard-refresh** after deployment:
   - **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl + F5` or `Ctrl + Shift + R`
   - **Mac**: `Cmd + Shift + R`
3. **Future deployments will auto-update** via GitHub Actions

### For New Contributors

1. **Clone repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/scott-a11y/proposal-builder.git
   cd proposal-builder
   ```

2. **Optional: Install git hook**:
   ```bash
   ./setup-git-hooks.sh
   ```

3. **Make changes and push** - automation handles the rest!
