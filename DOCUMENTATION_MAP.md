- ✅ Fewer frustrated "followed instructions but nothing works" reports
- ✅ Clear action items instead of conceptual explanations
- ✅ 95% of users never need to read advanced guides

## 💡 For Maintainers

### When adding new documentation:
1. **Ask:** Does this belong in CHANGES_NOT_SHOWING.md?
   - If YES: Add it there, not a new file
   - If NO: Only create a new file if it's truly specialized

2. **Always link** new guides from CHANGES_NOT_SHOWING.md if relevant

3. **Avoid circular references** - all roads should lead to CHANGES_NOT_SHOWING.md

4. **Test the flow** - Can a new user solve their problem in 1 guide?

### When someone reports confusion:
1. Check if CHANGES_NOT_SHOWING.md covers their issue
2. If not, add their scenario to CHANGES_NOT_SHOWING.md
3. Update this map if the structure changes

## 🎯 The Golden Rule

**One Guide to Rule Them All: CHANGES_NOT_SHOWING.md**

Everything else either:
- Points TO it
- Supplements it (advanced users)
- Explains concepts (optional reading)

**Never make users read multiple guides to solve common problems.**

---

## 📞 Quick Reference

**Problem:** Changes not showing
**Solution:** [CHANGES_NOT_SHOWING.md](./CHANGES_NOT_SHOWING.md)

**Problem:** Want to understand concepts
**Solution:** Read [WHERE_IS_MY_SITE.md](./WHERE_IS_MY_SITE.md) AFTER fixing your issue

**Problem:** Advanced debugging needed
**Solution:** [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md) AFTER reading main guide

**That's it. Really.**
