## Still Not Working?

If hard refresh doesn't work, the issue is NOT browser cache. Read:

### ‚Üí **[CHANGES_NOT_SHOWING.md](./CHANGES_NOT_SHOWING.md)** ‚Üê Complete troubleshooting guide

That guide covers:
- Site not deployed yet (most common!)
- Deployment configuration issues
- Multiple deployment locations
- GitHub Actions problems
- And more...

## üîç Why This Happened

The application uses a **cache-busting system** to ensure users always get fresh files:

```html
<script src="./role-mode.js?v=202510010442"></script>
                                  ‚Üë
                          Version timestamp
```

When the version number changes, browsers fetch fresh files. We just updated it from `202510010425` to `202510010442`.

**Your changes ARE in the code** - your browser just needed to be told to fetch them!

## üöÄ For Developers

After making changes to JS/CSS files:

```bash
./update-version.sh
```

This updates all version parameters automatically.
