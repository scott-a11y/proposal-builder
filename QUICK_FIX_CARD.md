## 🎯 What This Does

- **Bypasses the browser cache**
- **Fetches fresh copies** of all JavaScript and CSS files
- **Shows all your changes immediately**

---

## 🔍 Why This Happened

The application uses a **cache-busting system** to ensure users always get fresh files:

```html
<script src="./role-mode.js?v=202510010442"></script>
                                  ↑
                          Version timestamp
```

When the version number changes, browsers fetch fresh files. We just updated it from `202510010425` to `202510010442`.

**Your changes ARE in the code** - your browser just needed to be told to fetch them!

## 🚀 For Developers

After making changes to JS/CSS files:

```bash
./update-version.sh
```

This updates all version parameters automatically.
