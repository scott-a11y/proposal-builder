## Architecture Decision Status

**Decision Point**: Build System (Single-file vs. Modular)

**Status**: ‚è≥ TO BE DECIDED IN PHASE 1

**Options**:
- Option A: Keep no-build philosophy (simple, current approach)
- Option B: Introduce build system (Vite/Webpack for modularity)

**Decision Criteria**:
- Can single-file be cleaned up effectively?
- Is modularity critical for maintainability?
- Complexity vs. benefit tradeoff

**Decision Due**: End of Phase 1 Week 1
