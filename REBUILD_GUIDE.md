# Quick Start: Using the Rebuild Process

This guide helps you understand how the new PR blocking and rebuild process works.

---

## What Changed?

Three new mechanisms are now in place to ensure quality during the rebuild:

### 1. üõ°Ô∏è CODEOWNERS (`.github/CODEOWNERS`)
**What it does**: Requires @scott-a11y to approve ALL pull requests  
**Why**: Prevents unauthorized or out-of-scope changes during rebuild  
**How to use**: Nothing required - GitHub automatically requests review

### 2. üìã Rebuild Process (`REBUILD_PROCESS.md`)
**What it does**: Defines 6-week phased rebuild plan with acceptance criteria  
**Why**: Provides structured approach instead of incremental patches  
**How to use**: Read this document BEFORE creating any PR

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Contributing Policy (`CONTRIBUTING.md`)
**What it does**: Makes it clear that only rebuild-related PRs are accepted  
**Why**: Sets expectations for all contributors  
**How to use**: Read the warning section at the top

## For Contributors

### ‚ùå These PRs Will Be REJECTED:
- Bug fixes that don't follow the rebuild plan
- New features added to existing codebase
- Incremental improvements or patches
- Documentation that doesn't relate to rebuild

### ‚úÖ These PRs Will Be REVIEWED:
- Changes that implement a specific phase from `REBUILD_PROCESS.md`
- Critical security fixes (with prior approval)
- Documentation updates related to rebuild
- Changes that follow the PR template in `REBUILD_PROCESS.md`

### How to Create a Valid PR:

1. **Read the rebuild plan**: `REBUILD_PROCESS.md`
2. **Choose a phase**: Pick an unclaimed phase (1-5)
3. **Coordinate**: Comment on the rebuild issue to claim work
4. **Follow the template**: Use the PR template from `REBUILD_PROCESS.md`
5. **Include checklist**: Map your changes to acceptance criteria
6. **Provide evidence**: Screenshots, test results, staging URL
7. **Wait for review**: @scott-a11y will review and approve/request changes

## For the Repository Owner (@scott-a11y)

### Next Steps to Activate Full Protection:

1. **Enable Branch Protection** (in GitHub Settings):
   ```
   Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Add branch protection rule
   Branch name pattern: main
   
   Enable:
   ‚òë Require a pull request before merging
   ‚òë Require approvals: 1
   ‚òë Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
   ‚òë Require review from Code Owners
   ‚òë Require conversation resolution before merging
   ‚òë Require linear history (optional)
   ‚òë Include administrators (optional but recommended)
   ```

2. **Review the Rebuild Plan**:
   - Open `REBUILD_PROCESS.md`
   - Adjust timeline if needed
   - Modify phases based on priorities
   - Approve or edit the architecture decision

3. **Communicate to Stakeholders**:
   - Announce rebuild plan in GitHub Discussions
   - Set expectations with users
   - Notify any active contributors

4. **Prepare for Phase 1**:
   - Create `rebuild/v1` branch
   - Set up staging environment (if desired)
   - Review and approve Phase 1 plan

### How to Review PRs During Rebuild:

Use this checklist for every PR:

- [ ] PR title follows format: `Rebuild Phase N: [Description]`
- [ ] PR references `REBUILD_PROCESS.md` and specific phase
- [ ] Acceptance criteria checklist is complete
- [ ] All automated tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing evidence provided (screenshots/videos)
- [ ] No scope creep or unrelated changes
- [ ] Migration notes included (if applicable)
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Staging deployment works (if applicable)
- [ ] No console errors demonstrated

**If any item is missing**: Request changes with specific feedback

**If all items pass**: Approve and merge

## For Copilot Agents / Bots

If you are an automated system (Copilot Agent, Dependabot, etc.):

1. **Read** `REBUILD_PROCESS.md` to understand the current phase
2. **Only create PRs** that align with the active phase
3. **Use the PR template** provided in `REBUILD_PROCESS.md`
4. **Do NOT** create PRs for:
   - Incremental bug fixes
   - Dependency updates (unless critical security)
   - Code style changes
   - Refactoring unrelated to rebuild

5. **Always include**:
   - Which phase your PR addresses
   - Acceptance criteria checklist
   - Test results
   - How it fits the rebuild plan

## Blocking a Non-Compliant PR

If someone opens a PR that doesn't follow the rebuild plan:

### Template Response:
```markdown
Thank you for your contribution! However, this repository is currently undergoing a systematic rebuild.

**This PR does not align with the official rebuild plan.**

Please review:
- [REBUILD_PROCESS.md](./REBUILD_PROCESS.md) - Official rebuild phases
- [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) - Current contribution policy
- [FREEZE.md](./FREEZE.md) - Freeze status and rationale

### To proceed:
1. Review the rebuild plan
2. Identify which phase your change addresses
3. Follow the PR template in REBUILD_PROCESS.md
4. Coordinate with @scott-a11y before resubmitting

### Actions Required:
- [ ] Close this PR
- [ ] Review rebuild documentation
- [ ] Open new PR following the rebuild plan (if applicable)

**Labels**: `out-of-scope`, `rebuild-required`, `needs-response`
```

## FAQ

**Q: When will the freeze be lifted?**  
A: When all phases in `REBUILD_PROCESS.md` are complete and verified stable.

**Q: Can I contribute during the rebuild?**  
A: Yes! Follow the phases in `REBUILD_PROCESS.md` and coordinate with the maintainer.

**Q: What if I found a critical bug?**  
A: Report it as an issue with the `urgent` label. Critical security fixes may be accepted outside the rebuild plan.

**Q: Why can't we just fix things incrementally?**  
A: 70+ incremental changes were made without resolving root causes. A systematic rebuild is more reliable.

**Q: How long will this take?**  
A: Estimated 6 weeks based on the phased plan. May adjust based on complexity and resources.

**Q: What happens to existing PRs?**  
A: They will be reviewed for alignment with the rebuild plan. Non-compliant PRs will be closed with guidance.
