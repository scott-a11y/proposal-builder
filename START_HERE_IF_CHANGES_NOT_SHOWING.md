# üö® START HERE: Changes Not Showing Up?

## Do This RIGHT NOW:

### 1. Run This Command:
```bash
./check-deployed-version.sh
```

This tells you if your live site matches your code or not.

---

### 2. Read the Output

**If you see "‚ö†Ô∏è Cannot reach":**
- Your site isn't deployed at that URL
- Find where your site IS deployed (GitHub Pages settings, Netlify dashboard, etc.)
- See: [DEPLOYMENT_VERIFICATION.md](./DEPLOYMENT_VERIFICATION.md) for how to find it

**If you see "‚ùå OUTDATED":**
- Your code is on GitHub but NOT deployed yet
- **Wait 10 minutes** for deployment to complete
- Run the script again
- See: [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for details

**If you see "‚úÖ UP TO DATE":**
- Your code is deployed correctly
- The problem is your browser cache
- **Hard refresh**: Ctrl + F5 (Windows) or Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
- Try incognito/private mode

### 3. Still Stuck?

Read these in order:
1. [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md) - Step-by-step debugging
2. [DEPLOYMENT_VERIFICATION.md](./DEPLOYMENT_VERIFICATION.md) - Find where your site is deployed
3. [QUICK_FIX_CARD.md](./QUICK_FIX_CARD.md) - Browser cache issues

## The #1 Mistake

**‚ùå WRONG:** "I updated the code on GitHub, why don't I see changes?"

**‚úÖ RIGHT:** "I need to check if my hosting provider has deployed my changes AND clear my browser cache"

**Your code being on GitHub ‚â† Your live site being updated**
